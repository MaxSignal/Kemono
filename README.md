[Kemono](https://kemono.party) is an open-source reimplementation of [yiff.party](https://yiff.party/). It archives and dumps data, images, and files from paysites like Patreon.

Kemono's codebase consists of both importers to handle API data and a frontend to share it. While the status of the project is considered stable, there may be bugs and weird quirks here and there. Beware!

### FAQ
#### Where did the test scripts go?
The importer test scripts were removed in [v1.2](https://github.com/OpenYiff/Kemono/releases/tag/v1.2).
#### My instance uses too much memory!/My instance is randomly crashing!
Large instances may see memory issues due to the thumbnail generator. Either [set some swap space](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-16-04) or disable the feature in your `.env` file.
